it's called at program startup after all object with static storage duration are
initialized.

it's the designated entry point to a program that is executed in a hosted environment (that
is, with an operating system).
The name and type of the entry point to any freestanding program(boot loaders, OS kernel,
etc) are implementation defined.

The parameters of the 2-parameter form of the main function allow arbitrary multibyte 
character strings to be passed from the execution environment (these are typically known
as command line arguments). 

The pointers argv[1] .. argv[argc-1] point at the first characters in each of these strings.

argv[0] (if non-null) is the pointer to the initial character of a null-terminated
multibyte string that represents the name used to invoke the program itself

If the host environment cannot supply both lowercase and uppercase letter, the command
line arguments are converted to lowercase.

The strings are modifiable, and and modifications made persist until program termination,
although these modifications do not propagate back to the host environment: they can be 
used, for example, with strtok.

The size of the array pointed to by argv is at least argc+1, and the last element,
argv[argc], is guaranteed to be a null pointer.

The main function has several special properties:
1) a prototype for this function cannot be supplied by the program.

2) if the return type of the main function is compatible with `int`, then the return from
to main (but not the return from any subsequent, recursive, call) is equivalent to executing
the exit function, with the value that the main function is returning passed as the arguemnt
(which then calls the function registered with `atexit`, flushes and closes all streams, 
and deletes the files created with `tmpfile`, and returns control to the execution
environment).

3) if the main function executes a `return` that specifies no value or, which is the same,
reaches the terminating `}` without executing a `return`, the termination status returned
to the host environment is (until C99) undefined.
	if the return type of the main function is not `compatible` with `int` (eg. `void`
main `void`), the value returned to the host environment is unspecified. If the return type
is compatible with `int` and control reaches the terminating `}`, the value returned to the
environment is the same as if executing `return 0`.
