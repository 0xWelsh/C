it's called at program startup after all object with static storage duration are
initialized.

it's the designated entry point to a program that is executed in a hosted environment (that
is, with an operating system).
The name and type of the entry point to any freestanding program(boot loaders, OS kernel,
etc) are implementation defined.

The parameters of the 2-parameter form of the main function allow arbitrary multibyte 
character strings to be passed from the execution environment (these are typically known
as command line arguments). 

The pointers argv[1] .. argv[argc-1] point at the first characters in each of these strings.
